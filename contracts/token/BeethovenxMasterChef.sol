/*
    This master chef is based on SUSHI's version with some adjustments:
     - Upgrade to pragma 0.8.7
     - therefore remove usage of SafeMath (built in overflow check for solidity > 8)
     - Merge sushi's master chef V1 & V2 (no usage of dummy pool)
     - remove withdraw function (without harvest) => requires the rewardDebt to be an signed int instead of uint which requires a lot of casting and has no real usecase for us
     - no dev emissions, but treasury emissions instead
     - treasury percentage is subtracted from emissions instead of added on top
     - update of emission rate with upper limit of 6 BEETS/block
     - more require checks in general


    Changes from the above for V2:
    - Change from per block emissions to per second emissions due to Fantoms inconsistent block times
    - No treasury allocation, all rewards go to LP holders
    - Beets are not minted by the contract, but the contract holds them and distributes them
